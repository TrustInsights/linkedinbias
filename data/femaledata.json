    "text_content": "Australia's \"Great Firewall\" for teens has officially gone live. It's a global first, and the tech world is watching with bated breath. But peel back the headlines, and it's clear to see it's a policy as riddled with holes as it is well intentioned.\nHere's my TL;DR version of what is and isn't happening, what's exempt, and the new industries this ban is about to inadvertently create.\n1. The \"Safe\" List (Or, what isn't banned)\nThe government has drawn a line in the sand... but it's a total zig-zag.\nTikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, and X are gone. But a substantial proportion of the digital playground remains a no-go zone-free zone.\nMessaging is \"Safe\": WhatsApp and Messenger Kids are exempt. \ud83d\udc40\nGaming is \"Safe\": Roblox, Fortnite, and Discord\u2014platforms where in real life millions of kids primarily \"hang out\" with friends (and sometimes experience truly unmoderated anarchy)\u2014are broadly exempt or in the grey zone.\n\"Kids\" versions are safe (presumably) : YouTube Kids and Google Classroom.\nThe Irony: You can't scroll TikTok, but can arguably spend 6 hours in a Discord voice chat or a Roblox server. The lines between \"social media\" and \"gaming\" are 2010's thinking in a 2025 world.\n2. The New Industries This Will Breed\nWhenever you build a wall, you create a market for ladders. This is an economic stimulus package for two very specific industries:\nThe Compliance Complex: Prepare for a cottage industry in \"Age Assurance\" tech. Companies like K-ID and Yoti (pronounced \"yo-tee\") will become the new gatekeepers. Every platform now needs expensive, privacy invasive biometric tools to scan faces and check IDs.\nThe Evasion Economy: This is the darker side. We are about to see a \"grey market\" mushroom in size.\nVPNs: \"How to spoof your location to Norway\" will be the new \"how to top search term for every Australian 15-year-old.\nAccount Brokering: Expect to see a secondary market for \"verified\" 16+ accounts.\nAlt-Platforms: Expect kids to already be jumping to platforms like Yope and Lemon8 (owned by ByteDance) that no one is regulating yet... until the government plays whack-a-mole and bans those too.\n3. The Deeper Issue\nThis is the most important part in my opinion. The ban illuminates a terrifying dependence on \"Safety Theater.\" It lets the government say, \"We fixed it\" by putting shiny salve on a gory, open wound.\nBanning the platforms with safety teams, parental controls, and moderation (like Instagram) just to replace them with messaging apps and fringe sites where no one is watching. It's sweeping our failures to teach digital literacy and the uncomfortable truth that legislation is not parenting under the rug.\nWe aren't fixing the mental health crisis, we are just moving the conversation to a room where we can no longer hear it.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gUc6b_-Z\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

Ken Freire and I cohosted nearly two dozen podcasts strategically to have enough content into book chapters.\nI'm merely asking Claude to do the work of a ghost writer and smooth out the transcript into a working chapter.\nThe chapters are surprisingly good. It's completely authentic without adding anything more, though it certainly strategically left some pieces out or clipped pieces from different parts of the conversation together.\nIt's authentic AI.\nI've also used ChatGPT and Suno recently to put together a personal album for my wife. I went back through a number of meaningful events in the first year of our relationship, told ChatGPT the stories, had it write the lyrics, and had Suno make the music.\nIs it the same as me writing and recording it myself? No.\nDid it make her cry and laugh as we relived that season of our lives together? Yes.\nIt's authentic AI.\nThere are dozens of ways you can make this work. It all depends on the inputs you give it and the prompts you guide it with along the way.\nThis will be the standard way of doing things in a few years.\nJust wait.\n#Danche\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

Some people genuinely want to do this but struggle to find the time. Others just... don't want to. Find the people on the team that want to.\n2) \"What if they leave and take their audience?\"\nFair point. Build up 3-4 voices across your team. It spreads the risk and it's better for your overall reach too.\nHere's how you can get this going in your company:\n1. Find the right person\nLook for someone who genuinely want to do this AND have direct credibility with your ICP.\n2. Get them engaging (just 10 minutes a day)\nBefore they ever post anything, have them spend a few minutes commenting on posts from people in your industry. It's low-pressure, keeps them in the loop, and starts putting them in front of your audience.\n3. Make creating really easy for them\nMost people fail because creating content feels like work. So don't make them write posts. Instead:\n- Let them send voice memos with their insights while commuting.\n- Have a Slack channel where they drop random ideas\n- Let the marketing team turns it into actual posts\nThis way you're not asking them to become content creators. You're just capturing what they already know.\nI think the companies figuring this out right now are going to be way ahead in a year or two.\nHow many of you are doing this?\nWhere are you in your journey and what's biggest challenge you are having?"

Once they find someone interesting, they follow companies (and the people from those companies) to learn over time. ONLY when they're ready to convert into a lead or trial do they visit the websites of those companies.\n- They ask their peers in communities with other peers to get recommendations on what are the best companies to work with. They visit those company's websites ONLY once they've decided to learn more.\n- They consume even long-form content from companies without ever visiting the company's website: youtube, publishing video/podcasts, newsletters, then they're website once... (you get the idea).\nSo, if a company is doing marketing correctly by actively publishing/engaging on social, optimizing for LLMs, publishing video/podcasts/newsletters, then they're measuring awareness & nurturing prospects before they ever visit their website.\nBut are these companies measuring the impact of these things?\nWe weren't. We've been marketing this way for years.\nHowever, we really didn't have a good system to measure awareness, reach & engagement. So, the team recently put this funnel chart together. (See below.)\nWhile I was pushing the marketing team for awhile to measure awareness, reach & engagement on social media, I hadn't thought of putting it all on one big funnel.\nThe chart uses our data calculations feature to add metrics together from different places for these metrics:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Awareness: impressions across social media sites, ad impressions, etc.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Reach: unique people we're reaching across those same platforms.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Engagement: actions taken by people. Things like likes, comments, shares, clicking on a LinkedIn post, clicking on a link from a social site, etc.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 New contacts: every new contact we add in HubSpot. This includes people converting on the website, people we chat with on social, as well as contacts our sales team adds, etc. We can assume that we're somehow engaging with these people or trying to.\nThe funnel gets simple from there: people signing up for our trial, becoming a deal, buying, etc.\nBut now that we can see aggregate impressions, reach & engagement, we can experiment with new things to see what moves the needle.\nWe can also start measuring correlation between these metrics & our sales to ensure that our improvements in awareness, reach and engagement flows through to new customer acquisition.\nHow are you measuring this stuff?

But this year in particular feels like marketing and content teams became Hogwarts House Elves...\nSo - quick story - at this year's Executive Forum at Content Marketing World, we had a fascinating discussion on AI, and I asked what I thought was a simple question: \"Why do we HAVE to implement AI...?\"\nAlmost every answer fell into one of two buckets: fear or guilt.\n\"If we don't, we'll fall behind.\" \"If we don't, we're not doing our jobs.\" \"If we don't... well... the innovation convention gets stuffed in the glove compartment.\nNow, I'm not saying those things aren't true. They might be.\nBut I've seen this point of view in so many marketing teams lately - this rush to the finish line keeping noses down and somehow the hill gets steeper.)\nComing out of the holiday weekend, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude -as one does. Not the big, performative kind, but the quiet kind that grounds you. The kind that nudges you and says:\n\"What eyes am I using to see this moment?\"\nWe all look through different lenses: the rushed lens, the cynical lens, the overwhelmed lens, the \"I'm not doing enough\" lens.\nLately - both in business and, lets face it, life - I've found myself reaching for the lens of gratitude whenever I can. And that one... well, it changes not just what I see, but the speed at which I see it.\nIt reminded me of a client this year who embodies this idea far better than I do. I tell his story in the longer article, which I've linked in the first comment.\nAlbert Schweitzer once wrote: \"I always think that we all live, spiritually, by what others have given us in the significant hours of our life.\"\nThis year, with all the speed, struggle, and strange new possibilities, I'm choosing to look at those significant hours through the lens of gratitude.\nAnd I hope you will too.\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

This is a conversation that keeps coming up, and it's relevant to your personal investing decisions, and your career choices.\n[The AI Show Episode 183]: AI Job Automation, Is There an AI Bubble?, AI Political Divides,...\npodcast.smarterx.ai\nThis was a main topic on ep 183 of The Artificial Intelligence Show. Here are a few notes of what I shared:\nYou have to consider your own position from a personal investing perspective, but also from a career and business perspective.\nWhat is your long-term thesis on AI?\nWhat is your level of conviction?\nWhat is your appetite for risk?\nFor me, I bet everything personally and professionally starting in 2016 that AI would change the world. That every business in every industry would be AI Native, AI Emergent or obsolete.\nI bet on the companies that I thought were best positioned to grow when demand for intelligence scaled, and I built my own companies to help professionals and businesses accelerate their understanding and transformation.\nI believe we are still on the leading edge of an intelligence explosion.\nThat does not mean that every AI company survives.\nThere will be winners and losers.\nThere will be ups and downs.\nThere will be variables that are out of our control that will impact the markets, and AI progress, in the months and years ahead.\nWhat Accelerates AI Progress:\n- Algorithmic breakthroughs\n- Clean energy abundance (i.e. wind, solar, nuclear fission)\n- More efficient training and inference (e.g. smaller models, targeted search and retrieval in models like o1, brains, faster chips)\n- Cost of intelligence declines at a rapid rate\n- Energy breakthroughs (e.g. nuclear fusion)\n- Greater network and data security to reduce threats and increase trust\n- Infrastructure investments (e.g. upgraded and expanded electrical grids, more data centers)\n- Massive government funding (e.g. Apollo-type programs)\n- More compute capacity (i.e. more chips and fabs, plus more resilient chip supply chain)\n- New scaling laws\n- Other scientific breakthroughs (e.g. metacognition, quantum computing, new physics)\nWhat Slows AI Progress:\n- Breakdown in the AI compute supply chain through natural (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes) or human (e.g. physical or cyber sabotage) forces\n- Catastrophic events blamed on AI\n- Lack of adoption by enterprises\n- Landmark IP lawsuits that impact access to training data and model outputs\n- Restrictive laws and regulations (e.g. heavy regulation of open source models)\n- Societal revolt against AI due to job loss, politics, misinformation, and wealth inequality\n- Unexpected collapse in scaling laws\n- Voluntary or involuntary halt on model advancements due to catastrophic risk\nI think there is far greater risk in sitting back and assuming this is all a bubble, than positioning yourself and your company to thrive in the Age of AI.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gg5Vmtk9"

Having sat in both chairs gives me perspective on why this disconnect exists.\nTHE CMO PERSPECTIVE\nYou're drowning in tactical work while being asked to do more with less. Marketing budgets fell 15% (Gartner), yet the pressure to drive immediate results keeps intensifying.\nEveryone has an opinion about your work. The CEO wants leads. The CFO questions every dollar. Sales complains about lead quality. You're fighting fire drills while trying to build long-term brand equity that takes quarters to show results.\nTHE CEO PERSPECTIVE\nYou see massive marketing spend to revenue. When you ask \"what's the ROI on this campaign?\" you get complex answers about attribution, touches and conversion rates.\nIt's unclear how all the marketing activity impacts the business. You see a team of 15 people running webinars, writing blogs, and posting on social media \u2014 but you can't trace a direct line from that work to closed deals.\nMarketing feels like the only department that can't give you straight answers about what's working.\nTURNS OUT, BOTH PERSPECTIVES ARE RIGHT\nThe disconnect results from the fact that the system changed, but our mental models didn't keep up.\nMarketing used to work like a gumball machine: budget in, leads out. Everyone understood that model. It was measurable, predictable, linear.\nBut B2B buying completely changed. With 6\u201310 people in the buying committee, 70% of the journey happening anonymously, and 80% of buyers choosing vendors before ever talking to sales (6sense), the gumball machine is broken.\nBrand, positioning, and market perception now drive revenue more than any single campaign. But these operate on different timelines than the clean attribution CEOs want.\nTHE PATH FORWARD\nCEOs need to understand marketing the same way they understand product development. They don't write code, but grasp how it actually works now. Recognize that the gumball machine model is dead. Product market fit and brand are what creates the conditions that make revenue possible.\nCMOs need to speak the language of business outcomes the CEO tracks \u2014 pipeline efficiency, CAC trends, competitive win rates, deal velocity \u2014 while also educating leadership on why modern B2B buying makes short-term measurement meaningless. The complexity isn't an excuse. It's the reality of how buying committees make decisions across months-long journeys with multiple anonymous touchpoints.\nMutual understanding starts with both sides acknowledging that marketing isn't what it used to be. And that's not anyone's fault.\nWhat's been your experience bridging this gap? Where do you see the biggest misalignment between marketing and the C-suite?\n[Image/Video Placeholder]\nArticle 1: The GTM Reality Gap -- Why Effectiveness...\nlinkedin.com"

They're practically screaming the answer at you.\nStop chasing transformation. Start fixing what pisses people off.\nWhat manual process is your team secretly building workarounds for right now?"

And that [zero] credibility is quickly transfers to the author of the post. Yes, I understand content marketing, and yes, in my network there are very good examples of posting quality content daily. The difference is that AI shitpost narrative is so generic, it tells nothing of value.

I\u2019ve been there myself.\nFortunately, the key to getting the most out of these tools isn\u2019t mastering some complex prompt engineering system or saving a bunch of clever-sounding prompts you find online.\nIt\u2019s simpler than that. It\u2019s about context engineering. Which is a fancy way of saying that you need to give the model the right context to produce the best output.\nThink about when you brief a junior team member on a project. You just don't say \u201cwrite a landing page\u201d and walk away. You tell them who the audience is, what tone to use, what the goal is. You probably share an example of what good looks like.\nAI needs the same thing.\nSo when AI gives you garbage, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s usually because one of three things is missing. I call it the 3R Debugging Trick:\nROLE: Did you tell the model who it's pretending to be? (A conversion copywriter? A brand strategist?)\nREFERENCE: Did you give it examples, your brand voice, or context about your company?\nREQUIREMENTS: Did you specify structure, audience state, desired outcome?\nA vague prompt --> \"Write an email to nurture CFO leads for our software.\"\nA contextualized prompt --> \"Write a follow-up email to CFOs who downloaded our ROI calculator last week but haven't scheduled a demo. They're overwhelmed by manual reporting right now. Keep it under 150 words, reference the specific pain point they explored in the calculator, and include one customer proof point from the manufacturing sector. CTA should be low-friction: Ask if we can forward them two case studies of customers who were facing a similar situation.\"\nSame tool. Completely different output.\nThe real skill with AI is learning to provide better context. And the 3R framework gives you a 30-second diagnostic to check if you're doing that.\nNext time your AI output falls flat, don't give up and do it yourself. Use this 3R debugging trick first.\nYou'll be surprised how often that simple check turns a useless output into something you can actually work with.\nHave you run into this? What\u2019s been your experience trying to get useful output from AI?"

Now we're paying for it.\nJust re-read this brilliant 2015 FT piece (full article in the comments) about advertising\u2019s great plea for respect. And bloody hell, it reads like prophecy.\nTen years ago, whilst everyone was genuflecting before the altar of \u201cdigital metrics\u201d and \u201cperformance marketing,\u201d Byron Sharp was quietly publishing research showing that brands grow through physical and mental availability. Not loyal fans. That your actual customers are mostly people who buy you once every 18 months and ignore you the rest of the time.\nThe industry\u2019s response? \u201cLovely theory, Byron. Now excuse us whilst we spend millions building a TikTok presence for brand love.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what makes me want to weep:\nPepsi ditched the Super Bowl in 2010 for a \u201cdigital engagement project.\u201d Got millions of likes. Lost 5% market share. That\u2019s not a rounding error\u2014that\u2019s a catastrophe with a hashtag.\nMeanwhile, John Lewis created TV ads that made grown adults cry about penguins, and sold so much merchandise they had to apologise for the queue.\nWe traded effective reach for \u201cengagement.\u201d We traded \u201cmental availability\u201d (being remembered at the point of purchase) for \u201cengagement\u201d (three bot accounts and your mum).\nThe really depressing bit? Ten years later, we\u2019re still doing it. Still confusing performance marketing with brand building. Still chasing clicks instead of memory structures. Still letting data scientists tell us that emotion is \u201cinefficient.\u201d\nYou know what\u2019s inefficient? Spending a fortune targeting your \u201cloyalists\u201d whilst your competitor colonises the memories of everyone else.\nThe fame of a brand takes years to build but becomes, as Buffett understood, \u201ca gusher of cash, cascading down the generations.\u201d But we\u2019d rather have the dopamine hit of Tuesday\u2019s click-through rates.\nPerhaps the real lesson: In any industry threatened by technological disruption, the gravest danger isn\u2019t being too slow to adopt the new thing\u2014it\u2019s forgetting what made you valuable in the first place.\nOr as I\u2019d put it: we were so busy becoming data scientists, we forgot how to be interesting.\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

    "text_content": "Have you ever given a \"perfect\" speech? Not a good speech. Not an above-average speech. But the kind where something else enters the room?\nI had that experience last year. And even now, it's hard to describe. It felt almost other-worldly...an intensity I'd only felt one or two other times in 13 years of professional speaking - and the impact on my business has been unlike anything I've seen.\nBut here's what's so fascinating:\nIt wasn't a keynote.\nIt wasn't a massive stage.\nIt was a 90-minute sales class for about 100 boat and marine retailers.\nI had taught this same event four different times. Always great. Always productive. But nothing prepared me for what happened that day.\nFrom the moment I started speaking, I could feel something building inside me, as if my desire to help the room was too big to be contained. The energy wasn't normal. It wasn't rehearsed or fake. It was real. Almost physically overwhelming.\nAnd the audience...you could see it in their faces, their posture, their eyes.\nPeople in the conference hall were even crowding around the entrance of the session to watch, as there was clearly something \"special\" happening and everyone could feel it.\nBut after the event came the moment I'd never experienced before.\nFrom that room of roughly 100 attendees...\n11 different event invitations for 2025 came out of it.\nOne small audience turned into an entire year of work.\nAnd those 11 speeches?\nThey've had a major impact on my businesses - far more than I could have ever predicted. Leading to multiple other events and long-term coaching engagements.\nBut here's the part that keeps me thinking:\nI spoke for that same group four other times to that same audience...Why wasn't that magic there?? Why didn't those talks lead to a calendar full of opportunities?\nTruthfully? I don't know.\nSometimes life hands you a moment.\nAlmost like a window.\nAnd you get a surge of connection and clarity you couldn't script if you tried.\nAs a professional (speaker, salesperson, leader, etc.) you never know when that moment is going to hit. You never know which room, which audience, which seemingly \"regular\" day will become the door that opens dozens of doors.\nWhich is why the work matters.\nThe reps matter.\nThe showing up matters.\nDo the reps.\nKeep sharpening the craft.\nAnd when you least expect it...\nLightning strikes.\nPS: Today, I'm back at this same event for the Marine Retailers Association of the Americas (MRAA) for the fifth year in a row, and who knows, maybe we'll find lightning in a bottle twice... wish me luck! \ud83d\ude09\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

When will companies learn that using Generative AI as an \"alternative\" will *always* backfire and damage their brand image? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc47\nI've said this so many times, free of charge, that GenAI is not a human replacement, nor should it ever replace anything within your organisation \u2014 please refer to my previous posts, my articles on Youtube and TikTok, The CEO Retort podcast and newsletter.\nAs per Futurism 's report, mainstream companies like Coca-Cola and Google are jumping on this bandwagon to plop out new advertisements. There's just one issue: pretty much everybody hates it.\nThis writing has always been on the wall, lads. Maybe I should be charging for my free advice to make these people listen \ud83e\udd14\nThis year, McDonald's decided to get in on the corporate slopfest with a 45-second Christmas spot cooked up for its Netherlands Division by the ad agency TBWA\\Neboko. The entire thing is AI, and revolves around the thesis that the holiday season is the \"most terrible time of the year,\" according to the report.\n\u201cThe ad assaults the viewer with rapidly-changing scenes played out in AI\u2019s typically nauseating fashion, Because most videos generated with AI tend to lose continuity after a handful of seconds, scenes have become extremely quick, becoming one of the key tells that the clip you\u2019re watching is AI.\u201d\nAnd the user comments were brutal \ud83d\ude02\nAs Futurism put it perfectly, while the contractors behind the video may be proud of their technically impressive work, the public sentiment is clear. If we have to be constantly blasted by commodified sludge, they could at least be made by a human.\nI would add that it will be even better if we stop being bombarded by the obnoxious technobros!\nOK OK, I know I'm one of them. But I'm doing my best \ud83e\udd7a\nLarge language models (LLMs) can absolutely enhance many UX designs and ideas \u2014 I'm prioritising \u201cConversational User Interfaces\u201d, for example.\nBut the idea of using LLMs/GenAI as a replacement for designers, authors, video producers, artists, musicians and the like is simply ridiculous.\nAs Dr. Jeffrey Funk told me when we discussed the AI bubble this summer (while most people ignored the concept at the time), and as he said directly to me: these people do not understand work! [1]\nI mentioned many times that allowing your AI FOMO and, frankly, ignorance about how things actually work, to dictate your AI \u201cstrategy\u201d and how you choose to deploy AI will destroy your brand image. We've seen it with Duolingo, Klarna, Spotify, and many others.\nThis is why I mentioned in early 2024 that Apple, as an example, seem to be the only major company moving in the right direction by NOT jumping on this hype bandwagon. In fact, more recently I discussed why they appear to be abandoning the whole thing altogether [2][3][4]\nNo wonder Sam Altman came out calling Apple he's main rival \ud83d\ude02 [5]\nBe smart with your AI, or your customers will call you a moron (as per the comments to McDonald's ad) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n#ceo #ceor #ai #reality\n[Image/Video Placeholder]"

We fought until the IRS released $50M in March and another $40M in May.\nThen, we were one of the first PEOs to ensure that $5.2M in interest-related credits made its way back to the business owners who earned it.\nJustworks isn't just an HR platform. We're a relentless advocate. We show up when it's hard. And we believe every dollar of government relief belongs to the small businesses that rightfully claimed it.\nThank you to Inc. Magazine for this recognition, and to every customer who trusted us to fight alongside you."

Their audiences trust them, follow them, and act on their recommendations.\nAnd when you partner with them the right way, it shows.\nThe tactics are specific:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Go where the influence lives.\nFocus on platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube and Substack, where creators already have deep trust.\nDon't try to drag their audience to your site immediately. Play on their turf.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Ditch the straight demo.\nDon't script every word of what they say.

Technology multiplies and compounds the perspective that we -- People -- give to it. When our logic is flawed, tech makes it even more so.\nThat's exactly why #GenAI can be such a problem -- it is a stochastic mirror of human tribal knowledge on the internet. There's broad agreement that about 80-90 percent of that knowledge is non-fact. That doesn't mean it's necessary wrong or a lie, but it does mean that it's unproven and essentially an opinion. And because LLMs are reviewing information at a scale and speed that you and I cannot attain ourselves, it exacerbates where we get things wrong.\nThe goal of a business is to serve its customers and the marketplace with increasing effectiveness, something that give it the basis to charge money for its products or services.

They figured out something the rest of the industry hasn't caught up to yet.\nHere's what flipped it for me.\nLast month I built a full marketing site plus all the content from scratch. A year ago, I would have hired that out without giving it a second thought. Find a dev, hire a copywriter, manage 3 months of back-and-forth. Instead I knocked it out myself in a weekend, and the final result was superior to what I would have gotten doing it the old way.\nThat project rewired my brain. What else have I been paying for that I could just handle myself with the help of AI?\nNow I say yes to work I would've passed on before. Not because I'm grinding harder. The math just changed. I used to be limited by hours. Now the only limit is what I can think up.\nThe marketers still building teams and hiring everything out aren't against AI. They just haven't gone deep enough to see what it unlocks. You can't understand it until you've lived it.\nIf you still believe growth requires headcount, here's my challenge to you: pick your next project and use AI for as much of it as possible. Not as a sidekick. As the one doing the bulk of the work. Let it write the code. Design the ads. Generate the pile. You guide, it executes.\nOne project will change everything."

Again.\n\nShe asked me later: \"Why does he do that?\"\n\nHere's what I told her:\n\nEd was 3 when his mother was paralyzed by polio and his alcoholic father abandoned them. His nervous system never recovered. It stayed in perpetual threat detection mode.\n\nHe passed that to my mother. She passed it to me. I passed it to my daughter.\n\nNot through words. Through cells. Through mirror neurons. Through epigenetics.\n\nFour generations of women carrying an 83-year-old wound in our nervous system and mitochondria.\n\nAnd here's the part that should terrify healthcare leadership:\n\nMegan became a nurse.\n\nShe can't handle conflict. Can't set boundaries. Can't tolerate disappointment in others. Makes herself small. Apologizes for existing.\n\nNot because she's weak.\n\nBecause her great-grandfather's abandonment lives in her nervous system.\n\nAnd nursing FEEDS on this.\n\nSystems WANT nurses who:\n-> Make themselves small\n-> Avoid conflict\n-> Never push back\n-> Sacrifice endlessly\n\nThree weeks ago, a pharmacy error nearly killed Megan's patient. Not her fault. System failure.\n\nBut she CAN'T sleep. She replays it endlessly. She worries about her license.\n\nBecause the system doesn't carry trauma. Nurses do.\n\nThis is second-victim trauma layered on historical trauma layered on developmental trauma layered on generational trauma.\n\nTwo centuries later, you're likely STILL reenacting the traumas of your nurse predecessors. As was I.\n\nYou think it's dedication.\n\nIt's inherited oppression.\n\nI've analyzed over 1,000 nurses through my 2025 Trauma Assessment.\n\nTheir individual trauma scores are significantly higher than any other category.\n\nYour \"people-pleasing\" isn't a personality trait.\nYour \"work ethic\" isn't admirable.\nYour \"inability to say no\" isn't a character flaw.\n\nThey're adaptive trauma responses that healthcare systems exploit for profit.\n\nAnd your \"self-care\" won't fix it.\n\nBecause the problem isn't individual. It's systemic.\n\nAnd it's been transmitted through generations of nurses exactly like Ed transmitted trauma to Megan.\n\n76% of burnout symptoms are actually trauma responses.\n\nYou're not burning out. You're being traumatized. Daily. Systematically. By design.\n\nYour body never lied to you.\nThe system did.\n\nDrop a \ud83d\udc94 in the comments if you recognize this pattern in yourself or your team.\n\nAnd if you're a nurse ready to break this cycle, I've opened 47 spots in my Nurse Relief Starter at $47 (ends Dec 31).

Somewhere between scaling companies, building AI systems, and raising a family that passion faded into the background.\n\nThis year, it was unexpectedly reignited.\n\nNot because I suddenly became a musician (I didn\u2019t). But because I rediscovered music at a moment when attention, emotional regulation, and social connection are becoming even harder for kids to develop.\n\nI learned that:\n- Music activates more of the brain than almost any other stimulus. Language, motor control, memory, emotion, executive function all light up.\n- Kids ages 3 to 8 learn faster and retain longer through melody than spoken instruction.\n- Predictable rhythm strengthens communication pathways for neurodivergent learners.\n- Musical engagement improves attention, reduces anxiety, and supports emotional regulation, in both children and adults.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people pray through song. A reason nostalgia hits hardest when tied to melody. A reason certain songs help us focus when nothing else does.\n\nAs someone who has spent my career thinking about cognitive load, behavioral science, and decision support for humans at work, it\u2019s humbling to see how a simple melody can unlock what sophisticated tools often struggle with.\n\nIn many ways music is an underrated technology, one of the oldest we\u2019ve ever had, and maybe still one of the most powerful. Long before we talked about \u201chuman-centered design,\u201d communities were using rhythm and story to teach, heal, and pass down knowledge.\n\n#Music #LearningScience #MentalHealth #Neurodiversity #AIProductBuilder #HumanCenteredAI"

Why? \ud83e\uddd0\n\nThis semester, my team and I completed a deep-dive case study on The Rise and Fall of Microsoft's Xbox/Groove Music.\n\nWhat started as a research assignment quickly became one of the most interesting product projects I've worked on. We explored the full lifecycle of Microsoft's music ecosystem, from the Zune era to Xbox Music, to Groove's eventual migration to Spotify.\n\nAlong the way, we analyzed:\n\ud83d\udcc9 The strategic decisions behind Microsoft's entry into digital music\n\ud83d\udcb8 Why music streaming is structurally unprofitable for tech giants like Microsoft\n\ud83d\udcf1 How cross-device priorities (especially Windows 8 UX) derailed user adoption\n\ud83d\udd70\ufe0f The major impact of late investment in iOS and Android apps\n\nOne of the highlights of this project was speaking with former Microsoft leaders who worked directly on the product. Their perspectives helped us understand not just what happened, but why it happened, especially around licensing economics, internal alignment, and the strategic timing of key decisions.\n\nWe boiled down our research into three key lessons for me as a marketer:\n\n1. Audience & Platform Fit\nJust because an ecosystem exists doesn\u2019t mean it shows up where the users are. Even strong ideas fail when they\u2019re confined to the wrong hardware.\n\n2. Positioning & Business Reality\nBrand, partnerships, and pricing only work when they align with user behavior. Marketing messaging has to reflect how the business truly makes or loses money.\n\n3. Timing & Ecosystem Strategy\nIn fast-moving consumer categories, timing is often the difference between leading the market and missing it entirely.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of this deck and grateful to everyone who helped us along the way!\n\nHuge thanks to our professor, Adam Fratto, for pushing us to connect storytelling with strategy, and to my teammate Xuanxu Lu for her incredible visual input and teamwork on this case study. I am especially thankful for the industry professionals who generously shared insider insight\u2014their perspective added depth far beyond public sources.\n\nIf you're working on entertainment, platforms, or media strategy, I'd love to connect and chat. Always excited to learn from others who are thinking about timing, ecosystems, and audience behavior.\n\n\u2753Question for the community: Looking at today's market, what is the biggest lesson from the Xbox Music story that modern streaming services should still be paying attention to?\n\n#streaming #music #research #xboxmusic #groovemusic #casestudy #microsoft #GrooveMusic #CaseStudy #TechHistory #MarketingStrategy #Techmarketing [video]"

The drummer might love your idea, but she probably doesn't control the master recording, the entire composition or potentially even her own likeness rights.\n\nEVEN IF your drummer friend controls everything, you still need to make this call: \"I know you make music for a living, but would you discount your work for our six-figure marketing campaign?\" \ud83d\udcc9\n\nConsider the alternative: position your brand as a valued, repeat music partner. Pay fair fees. Build real relationships across labels, publishers, and artists. Create opportunities that thrill both your target audience and the artist's audience.\n\nWhat's better \u2013 asking your friend for a discount while hoping they own all the rights, or building stunning brand creative that artists actually want to work with?\n\n#MusicStrategy #BrandMarketing #MusicLicensing #MarketingLeadership #CMO [video]"

I felt sick. - Michael Green\nFor 1963, that floor made sense. Housing was relatively cheap. A family could rent a decent apartment or buy a home on a single income. Healthcare was provided by employers and cost relatively little. Childcare didn't really exist as a market, mothers stayed home, family helped, or neighbors watched each other's kids. Cars were affordable. Few frills, College could be covered with a summer job. Retirement meant a pension income, not a 401(k) you had to fund - Michael Green\nBut everything changed between 1963 and 2024.\nHousing costs exploded. Healthcare became the largest household expense for many families. Childcare became a market, and expensive. College went from affordable to crippling. Transportation costs rose. .... The composition of household spending transformed completely. If you keep Orshansky's logic, if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food's budget share, but adjust the multiplier to reflect today's reality, the multiplier is no longer three. It becomes sixteen. - Michael Green\nOuch.\nEverything's more, and working to cover just ads more costs. Feels a bit Arkansas Chicken farmer.\nGreat find Katie. Thanks for the intro Chris.

They sound careful and professional—but as Matt points out, they can turn hunger and poverty into something abstract and distant, instead of a mother skipping meals so her kids can eat or a senior choosing between rent and medicine.\nIn my earlier work with Energy Express, we talked about \"food deserts\" and \"literacy deserts\" to connect empty pantries and empty bookshelves in kids' lives. That framing helped, but this piece is a good reminder that even when we use accepted terms, we can lose sight of the real human stories underneath them.\nThrough Pangaea Strategies, my work now focuses on bringing community members, nonprofits, and funders to the same table. It’s a daily challenge to remember that the way we talk about those needs shapes whether people feel seen or erased. I can’t stop using the language in grants and reports, but that can’t become an excuse to sand down the edges of the room with funders, nonprofits, companies, and communities.\nIf our work is about dignity and fairness, then our language has to reflect the messiness of people’s lives, not blur it. I’m going to be much more intentional about saying hunger when I mean hunger, and poverty when I mean need.\nHighly recommend this piece for anyone in philanthropy, nonprofits, or policy work.

But as we celebrate these medical marvels, we must confront a stark reality: for the majority of poor people in rural America, these treatments are nothing more than a fantasy.\nThe cost—often exceeding $1,000 a month without comprehensive insurance—is a luxury the rural poor simply cannot afford. This isn't just about weight; it's about a deep-seated issue of health equity and the social determinants of health.\nAs White River Now reports on initiatives to boost rural health access, we need to connect the dots...\n• Poverty & Isolation:\nHigh poverty rates, fewer job opportunities, and lack of affordable, healthy food options (food deserts) are rampant in rural areas.\n• The Vicious Cycle:\nBeing in a place with limited resources, opportunities, and support can lead to crippling stress and depression. And honestly, if that was you, you would eat too. Food often becomes one of the few accessible comforts in a life defined by struggle.\n• Stigma and Scarcity:\nTo tout these expensive, life-changing drugs without addressing the financial barriers to access only reinforces the cruel \"dog-eat-dog\" nature of a health system that leaves the most vulnerable with nothing.\nA true health revolution means affordable, accessible care for everyone, regardless of their zip code or income.\nIt cannot be a \"breakthrough\" that is only available to the wealthy and insured.

The cries of their hearts deafened my soul as I stood before this gate.\nI came to a heavy realization: The gate is old, but the enemy is still active.\nIt is often easy for us to view slavery as a relic of history. We think that the chains are gone. But today, millions of people still live in modern slavery. The mechanics have changed, but the root driver remains the same: Poverty.\nPoverty is a brutal master. It takes advantage of a vulnerability so deep that it strips away dignity. It forces desperate choices. It shoves people to hand over their lives to systems of exploitation, often masked as opportunity.\nPoverty tells a child they have no value. It creates spiritual chains of hopelessness that bind our hearts just like iron on the wrists.\nThis is why I am so passionate about the work we do at Compassion International.\nOur goal is not to provide \"charity.\" It is warfare against the chains of poverty. By releasing children from poverty in Jesus name, we are destroying the very foundation that allows slavery and bondage to thrive. We are fighting for spiritual and physical freedom with real hope for the next generation.\nCompassion International offers a different gate. It's the one Jesus spoke of when He said, \"I am the door\" (John 10:9).

I've been deep in the data on SNAP (what we all know as food stamps), and I wanted to share what I found in my new newsletter.\nI started with a simple question: which states are most \"dependent\" on this help?\nBut what I found was eye-opening. The gap between states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island vs. states like Wyoming and New Mexico was HUGE.\nThe economic reliance in New Mexico and D.C. is more than four times higher than in Wyoming.\nBut the why is the real story. It's not just unemployment. I found a \"working poor\" paradox: states like Massachusetts and New Mexico have low unemployment but are still in the top 5 for dependency. People are working, but the jobs just don't pay enough to make ends meet.\nThe most important takeaway for me was who we're really talking about. When you strip away the politics, 70% of all SNAP recipients are kids, seniors, or people with disabilities.\nThis reliance creates a serious vulnerability. A federal shutdown isn't a \"news story\" in a high-dependency state; it's a direct threat to the food security of one in every five people.\nI wrote about all of it in a conversational, folksy style, just like this.

So why, during an ongoing employment crisis, are more roadblocks being added?\nPeople have been out of work for months, some even years. They’re facing evictions, food insecurity, and mental health struggles. Some are slipping into homelessness—and it’s not because they aren’t trying.\n🚫 The Easy Apply feature is often the only accessible option for those juggling job searches, survival, and limited resources. Throttling this tool feels like punishing the very people who need support the most.\nSo I ask:\nWhy now?\nWhy limit access?\nWhy make it harder to get back on our feet?\n💬 To fellow job seekers: Have you noticed this new limitation? How has it affected your ability to apply?\n💬 To LinkedIn: Why add friction to a process meant to create opportunity?\nWe need more access, not less.

Today, I want to speak directly and plainly about why we promote our DBCC members so intentionally, and why we urge our community to spend their dollars with them.\n\nFor generations, mainstream corporations have received the majority of our consumer spending, often without reinvesting back into our neighborhoods. While they profit, our small businesses, our innovators, our job creators, our community builders, fight twice as hard for visibility, resources, and economic opportunity.\n\nThat's why we choose to spotlight, celebrate, and elevate our members.\n\nDBCC members are more than businesses, they are the heartbeat of Dallas' Black commerce. They create local jobs, support local families, and infuse our culture through service, products, and integrity. When you support a DBCC member, dollars circulate right here at home, strengthening our ecosystem from the inside out.\n\nStarting today, we'll be showcasing our incredible DBCC members across your timelines and inboxes—not just for you not only to know who they are, but to support them—buy their products, use their services, and share their businesses with others.\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, remember that these businesses aren't just names on a list. They are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods and the reason our communities continue to thrive.\n\nThank you for choosing to uplift and invest in our members!\n\nThis isn't just about buying Black. It's about building a future where our businesses stand strong without waiting for validation from mainstream corporations.\n\nLet's make intentional decisions.\nLet's invest in the entrepreneurs who invest in us.\nLet's make sure our dollars reflect our values.\n\nSpend with DBCC businesses.

But Let Me Tell You Why That Matters.\n\nOne thing about me: I'm going to show up as my authentic self.\n\nAnd the older I get, the more I ❌ refuse to #code-switch to make other people comfortable.\n\nYesterday, I had a moment where I asked my #AI assistant for help refining a message. But what I realized is this... even AI will shift your tone based on the type of prompt you give it.\n\nSay it softly, and it gives you soft.\nSay it direct, and it gives you direct.\nSay it boldly, and it gives you bold.\n\nBut here's the part that hit me:\n\nIf I'm not careful, I could accidentally code-switch my own voice through the prompts I write.\n\nAnd as a #Black #woman, that #awareness mattered to me.\n\nBecause for years, we've been told to soften ourselves. To tone down. To package our truth. To make sure we don't come across as too strong, too confident, too direct, too honest.\n\nBut #authenticity is clarity.\nAuthenticity builds #trust.\nAuthenticity is #alignment.\n\nSo I had to remind myself:\n\nI don't need to dilute who I am to communicate effectively. ✨\n\nI can be warm, direct, truthful, and powerful all at the same time.\n\nAnd if someone misreads my intention after I've been clear, that is not my burden.\n\nWhat I love about using AI is that it reflects right back to me what I put in. It showed me that when I lead with authenticity, the output will follow suit.\n\nSo here's my takeaway:\n\nWhether it's AI, #work, #leadership, or relationships... give the world the real you. Not the edited you. Not the palatable version. The aligned version.\n\nBecause when you show up fully as yourself, people always know how to meet you.\n\nAnd that is the most powerful brand of all.\n\nGo be Great,\n🌻 Mrs. P 🌻"

And if that is true, what does #there look like for Milwaukee?\n\nThese conversations don't flow as easily as they did a couple years ago, because it feels more easy than ever to say the #wrong #thing. But I wonder how people are quietly feeling about the shift (or the lack of one) from DEI language to #inclusion and #belonging. My friend Daniel Terrio, M.S. reminded me that this work used to be called #tolerance. Remember that? So the shifts are not new, and they probably are not over.\n\nSo, indeed I'm curious. #How #are #you #feeling about all of this? What would you like to see from #employers, #elected officials, and #community #leaders and your #networks? What questions are you sitting with? What makes you mad or relieved? Where could you use a sounding board or a thinking partner? And would you feel comfortable exploring this in a town hall style conversation? If you'd rather send me private message, that's welcomed too."

Support looks like grace, choosing to see your sister through a lens of love instead of suspicion.\n\n2️⃣ Celebrate Loudly, Not Quietly\nSilent claps don't break systems. Repost the win, speak the name in rooms, remind her that her success strengthens all of us.\n\n3️⃣ Create Soft Landing Spaces\nBeing \"the strong one\" is glorified, but rarely do we have places to be soft. Support means saying, \"You don't have to be the introduction. Move from \"I hope you win\" to \"Here's how we can win together.\"\n\n4️⃣ Share Access, Not Just Advice\nAdvice is easy. Access changes lives. Send the job link. Make the introduction. Move from \"I hope you win\" to \"Here's how we can win together.\"\n\n^^ Because being strong isn't the issue. It's being strong alone that's breaking us.\n\nWhich of these speaks to you most right now?\n\n#Blackwomen #Supportblackwomen #Black #LeadershipWithCare #RestReclaimRise #BlackWomenInLeadership #EmotionalWellness #AbundanceMindset #DynastisWealth #SupportEachOther #CommunityCare #Heal\n[IMAGE]"

This is significant as we look to fungi to provide new solutions to protect us from the effects of space travel - and here on earth, where safe and natural sunblock products are much needed.\n\nOver the next several posts, I'm going to walk you through all the trail & error it took for me to get to this stage, including:\n* Preparing liquid culture of Aureobasidium pullulans\n* Fermenting several liters of media\n* Acid / base extraction of the melanin\n* Generating a melanin film for the UV experiment\n* Finally, demonstrating UV blocking ability using UV-sensitive cyanotype paper\n\nBe sure to like this post and follow me so you don't miss the updates!
